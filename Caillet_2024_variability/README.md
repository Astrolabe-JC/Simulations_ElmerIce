Paper submitted to Earth System Dynamics

* ElmerIce v7.0 : compilation TGCC - elmerfem-29fd3bf4_bis-opt. 
  
* Antarctic configuration derived from ISMIP6-2300 project 
see https://github.com/pmathiot/ELMER_ISMIP6_Antarctica/releases/tag/v2023.0 for more explanations.

* Simulations until 2100 under medium SSP2-4.5 scenario:
  - 5 with IPSL-CM6A-LR forcing : 5 members for ocean (members 1, 3, 6, 11, 25) and member 1 for atmosphere)
  - 4 with UKESM1-0-LL forcing : 4 members for ocean (members 1, 2, 4 and 8) and member 1 for atmosphere)
  - 2 with MPI-ESM1.2-HR forcing : 2 members for ocean (members 1, 2) and member 1 for atmosphere)
 
* Correction of ocean TÂ° for PICO melt parameterisation to match observed estimates (Adusumilli et al. 2020) are also added.

* Output, initial state and forcing files available on request to <justine.caillet@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr>
